Back in 2012, I go to CJCC library to read some Japanese book. 
At that time, I can’t read any letter in Japanese. 
All I can do is to read books written in English. 

I found a great manga about the founder of Honda company, Mr. Honda Soichiro. 
I was inspired a lot by his life work. 
I wanted to be an inventor like him and it is always one of the motivations for me to pursue my study in Japan. 

And now, 5 years later, I lost my confidence, I forgot all my dream. 
I start to question myself “why I need to be here in the first place?”. 
I think after living here for while, I started to see things that don’t go well like what I planned. 
Maybe reading that manga again and watching short video would remind me back the motivation I used to have back then.

This is my favorite quote from Mr. Honda:      
- People called me a mad inventor.
- But to do great work, you have to be passionate almost to point of madness.
- To create something from nothing, you need commitment.      
- You have to forget everything else and give it you all.
- You try, try and try.      
- When you finally succeed, that feeling …
- All the money in the world can’t buy that feeling, there is nothing like it.  

I think to bring back the motivation, we have to learn to become a kid, learn to dream big, learn to dream the impossible again.  That is the power of the dream.
