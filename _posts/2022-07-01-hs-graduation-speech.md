This post contains the speech I wrote for the graduates of AUPP High School, class of 2023, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Introduction
======

Good morning, esteemed faculty, proud parents, and the remarkable graduates of AUPP High School - Foxcroft Academy, class of 2023. 
It is an honor to stand before you today as we celebrate this important milestone.

Today, we gather here to recognize and celebrate the exceptional achievements of each and every one of you. 
Your dedication to academics, artistic brilliance, athletic skills, and valuable community contributions have made a significant impact on our school and beyond.

Many of you were my first students when I joined this school two years ago. 
Today, as we celebrate your graduation, I am deeply honored to witness how much you have grown, overcome challenges, and transformed into the remarkable individuals you are now.

Time has passed quickly, and I wish I had more time to spend with you and share my life lessons. 
At this moment, I would like to share two important things. 

The world beyond high school
======

As you transit from high school to university, you will experience significant changes. 
You will no longer be the center of attention, but that doesn't mean we care any less about you. 
It is the reality of the world out thereâ€”you must prove your worth and demonstrate your abilities. We are preparing you for the real world, where you will become more responsible and independent.

Along your journey, you will face setbacks, doubts, and moments when things don't go as planned. 
But remember, failure is a natural part of growth, it is a sign of pushing beyond your comfort zone. Even the greatest minds encountered setbacks on their path to success.

I want you to know that you're not alone in these experiences. 
As I stand here today, I hope it serves as a testament that it's okay to be different, take risks, and learn from failures.
You need to embrace failure as an integral part of your journey, learning from it and using it to fuel your determination to overcome any obstacle.


The importance of being a good human being
======

In a world driven by advancing technology, it is easy to assume that your worth is solely determined by your technical skills and capabilities. 
However, I think it's the complete opposite. It's crucial to remember the exceptional value of human qualities. 
While Artificial Intelligence (AI) may excel in certain areas, it cannot replicate the depth of human emotions, empathy, and genuine connections.

As you embark on your journey beyond AUPP High School, I want you to cherish and nurture your unique qualities as human beings. 
Please be kind, understanding, and appreciative of others' presence. 
Make efforts to engage in meaningful conversations, listen attentively, and embrace the power of empathy by putting yourself in someone else's shoes. 
Last but not least, recognize the value each person brings to the table.

Your ability to coexist, appreciate others, and make a positive impact on their lives is where your true value lies. 
Please carry with you the knowledge that no Artificial Intelligence (AI) can replace: the power of being a good human being.

Farewell
======

Before I conclude, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has played a significant role in shaping these bright individuals before us.
To the graduating class of AUPP High School - Foxcroft Academy, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes for a future filled with endless possibilities. 
May your dreams soar high, and may your journey be filled with joy, purpose, and fulfillment. Thank you.
