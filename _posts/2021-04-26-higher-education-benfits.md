A student of mine as me the following questions
* What are the benefits of higher education such as a Master's and Ph.D.? 
* What can we improve/learn more than bachelor?

I think the answer will differ from person to person. I suggest u ask a few people and compare their answers.This answer is based on my experience as a master graduated from abroad.

Short Answer
======
Nothing. Like Feynman once said “Never confuse education with intelligence, you can have a PhD and still be an idiot.”

Long Answer
======

Salary: People is willing to pay you more if you have higher degree.
This is the first salary (annual income) differences of college graduates (science and engineering) in Japan, Europe and US.
* Japan: Master $30,000 / PhD $35,000
* Europe: Master $50,000 / PhD $70,000
* US: Master $70,000 / PhD $100,000

Credibility: People tend to trust you more if you have higher degree.

Skill: You acquire more skills (especially research related) if you have higher degree.
* Bachelor: Be able to solve a problem using a solution proposed by your supervisor
* Master: Be able to propose a solution and solve the problem formulated by your supervisor
* PhD: Be able to formulate a new problem, propose a solution and solve it
As you can see, you trained yourself to do more as you have higher degree.

Opportunity: There are more job options that you can choose (academia, industry, startup, etc) if you have higher degree.
* If you only have bachelor, you can only work for industry but not academia
* If you have master degree, you have a few more options than bachelor
* If you have a PhD, you can work anywhere in the world

Finally, I would like to end this with a story. A friend of mine used to ask an astronaut this question.
“I’m about graduate from my master degree now, do you think it is a good idea for me to go on for doctor degree? Should I work for a company and get experience first?”

The astronaut gave the following answer:
“You should find something you can enjoy throughout your life. Then, it doesn't matter whether you're getting a doctor degree or working for a company.”
