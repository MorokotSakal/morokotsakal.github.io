I guess many juniors is busy writing their study plan this month.

The best advice I could give is asking your seniors for help by letting them read your study plan.

Your senior can show you how they wrote it and give you a good feedback.

Also please try to read good study plans as much as possible. 

Think about this:How can you cook like a master chef if you never taste the master chef’s food?

Same goes with your study plan.

You won’t able to write a good study plan if you’ve never seen what a good study plan look like.

To write a good study plan, you need to answer three questions:

1. What is your future plan, goal and vision?
2. Can you describe what you have learned until now? Your achievement, research experience?
3. What do you want to learn, and research at university/graduate school?

After answering these questions, the rest is easy.

You just need to connect these dots and make a good story.
