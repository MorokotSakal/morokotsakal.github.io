I read the news today about Vietnam launching their satellite into space. At the same time, many people start questioning whether Cambodia is able to do the same. Therefore, I decided to do some research and share my thought on this topic. Space has always been an inspiration for me since I was a little kid.  I have a strong interested in satellite and do believe it has plenty of benefits for Cambodia. If you are curious about how they did it, here how.

In the past, satellite development have been progressed as a project led by state organizations such as NASA or JAXA because it usually requires enormous budgets and expenses. However, recent miniaturization of electronic technology makes it possible for the new type of satellite called small satellite to be born. Recently, many universities and company around the world started to develop microsatellite as tools for education and technology demonstration.

Even though most people might not notice but every one of us is actually holding a satellite in our hand. To put it simple: a smartphone can actually be considered as a satellite. If we put a smartphone in a rocket and launch it into space, it will become a satellite. Although in reality, we need to test a lot of things such as vibration test, thermal vacuum test, etc before we are able to put it into orbit.

Most satellite carries camera for taking the picture from space for weather analysis, etc. Conventional sensor used inside smartphone such as a gyroscope, used in the mobile game, is used for sensing the satellite orientation. Apart from these, a satellite requires a transmission system for receiving the command from the earth as well as sending its data back to earth. 

Small satellites are usually launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) which range from 100 km to 2000 km above the earth. Therefore, it has a very short lifespan of a few weeks to 2 years, depending on the orbit.

So How Vietnam Did That?
======
As I know, this satellite you heard in the news is not their first satellite. The first small satellite from Vietnam was launched in August 2013 which is called "PicoDragon". Its size is 10cm x 10cm x 11.35cm and weight 1 kg [2]. Vietnamese engineers developed this PicoDragon with help from the Japanese space agency (JAXA). During the development of PicoDragon, many Vietnamese students were sent to study in Japan. They went there to learn about the fundamental techniques for designing and operating such a system. The current satellite that you just read in the news is probably their second satellite (since I could not find any reference for this one yet) [3]. I finally found a reference about Vietnam's second satellite. It is called "MicroDragron" and was officially launched in January 19th, 2019. 

So You Might Want to Ask: Can We Also Make Satellite
======
Sure, I think we can. As long as we can persuade the government that it is worth doing so and that it has an impact on our daily life. Since putting a satellite in space is quite expensive, the real question to ask is not "How do we do it?". It shall be "We do it for what purpose?". In my opinion, it is for education. We should follows Vietnam footstep of sending student to study about how to make satellite. It teach our student a lot of engineering skills which is hard to obtain in the current education system in Cambodia. 

For reference, if you want to put the pico-satellite (size of your smartphone) that was mentioned earlier, I think it costs around 20, 000 USD (roughly estimation: just for the launch, however, development cost is not included). Considering that there is no propulsion system to keep it at the same altitude, pico-satellite could last in space for only a month (it depends on what height it fly around the earth). It is the cheapest option found today. However, the cost is going to be cheaper in the near future because many companies are expanding their business in aerospace industries, for example, SpaceX. These companies are the driving force to lower the price of launching such satellite.
